### Forecasting the random walk

This an attempt to remotely change my webpage through rstudio. AGAIN

```{r}
install.packages("forecast")
install.packages("prophet")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rbcb")

# Load libraries
library(forecast)
library(prophet)
library(tidyverse)
library(rbcb)

```





```{r}
# Importing necessary libraries
# Fetch USD/BRL exchange rate from BCB API
exchange_rate <- rbcb::get_series(3691, start_date = "2023-10-01", end_date = "2024-10-10")

# Check the first few rows of the data
length(exchange_rate)


```
